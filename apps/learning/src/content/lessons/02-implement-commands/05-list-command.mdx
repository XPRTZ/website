## Exercise

The last command to implement is the list command. This command should display all the environment variables stored in the database for a given directory. If no directory is provided, it will display a list of all stored directories.

### list

Lists stored directories or environment variables.

```envtamer list [DIRECTORY_NAME]```


- `DIRECTORY_NAME`: Optional. The directory to list env variables for.

If no directory is specified, this command lists all directories stored in the database. If a directory is provided, it lists all environment variables stored for that directory.

### Go

We will need to implement the last function on the storage class, the **listDirectories** function. We should be able to implement it without any new packages or functions.

### Python
