## Exercise

We will implement the functionality of the pull command. The pull command will accept an argument for the directory to pull and optionally a filename to write the environment variables to.

### pull

Pulls environment variables from the database to a local .env file.

```envtamer pull [DIRECTORY_NAME] [-f|--filename <FILENAME>]```


- `DIRECTORY_NAME`: Required. The directory in the database to pull env variables from.
- `-f|--filename`: Optional. The name of the env file to create or update. Defaults to '.env'.

This command retrieves stored environment variables for the specified directory from the database and writes them to a local .env file. If the file already exists, it will prompt for confirmation before overwriting.

### Go

We will need a new method on the database to get the environment variables for a given directory. It will return a map of key-value pairs for the given directory.

To write a file on disk, we can use the bufio package together with the os package to create a file.

```go
import (
  "os"
	"bufio"
)

file, err := os.Create(path)
writer := bufio.NewWriter(file)
```

### Python

To write a file on disk, we can use the built-in open function with the 'w' mode to create a new file or overwrite an existing one.

```python
with open(full_path, 'w') as file:
```
