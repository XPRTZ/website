## Exercise

We will implement the functionality of the push command. When run, it will read the contents of an **.env** file in the current directory and save it to the database.
Optionally, you can pass a directory as argument to the command and it will read from that directory instead of the current one. You can also pass the --filename option to specify a different filename than the default **.env**.

### push

Pushes the contents of a local .env file to the database.

```envtamer push [DIRECTORY_NAME] [-f|--filename <FILENAME>]```

- `DIRECTORY_NAME`: Optional. The directory containing the .env file. Defaults to the current working directory.
- `-f|--filename`: Optional. The name of the env file. Defaults to '.env'.

This command reads the specified .env file and stores its contents in the database, associated with the given directory.

### Go

To store the environment variables as key-value pairs you can use a map in Go. Both keys and values are strings. The keys represent the environment variable names, and the values represent their associated values.
```go
envVars := make(map[string]string)
```

The **bufio.Scanner** is utilized to read the file line-by-line efficiently. This is particularly useful for processing text files like .env files, which contain environment variables listed line by line.

```go
import (
	"bufio"
)

scanner := bufio.NewScanner(file)
```

The strings package's functions are essential for text processing and manipulation in Go. They are highly optimized and provide robust support for handling UTF-8 encoded strings, making them indispensable tools for working with string data.

```go
import (
	"strings"
)

strings.TrimSpace(...)
strings.SplitN(...)
```
