## Exercise

### Go

In the Go implementation we can apply some refactoring. Some functions are not placed in a logical place because they are used in multiple places.

Create an util folder and create a file named env.go to contain the functions that have to do with working writing, reading and parsing environment variables.

```go
func ParseEnvFile(path string) (map[string]string, error)

func WriteEnvFile(path string, envVars map[string]string) error

func ResolvePath(path string) (string, error)
```

Update the files which use these functions.
