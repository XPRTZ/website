## Project setup

Clone the reference C# implementation. This will be used to guide us on creating the Go and Python versions of the CLI tool.

```
git clone https://github.com/XPRTZ/envtamer
```

Create a new Git repository for this workshop locally and push it on your own GitHub account. This will be the repository where we will work on.

```
github.com/username/envtamer-workshop
```

```
â”œâ”€â”€ go
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ .gitkeep
â””â”€â”€ python
    â””â”€â”€ .gitkeep
```

### Go

Make sure you are in the go directory of the project

```
npx gitignore go
go mod init github.com/username/envtamer-workshop
go get -u github.com/spf13/cobra@latest
go get -u modernc.org/sqlite
```

In the root of the go folder there should now be a go.mod file. This file lists all the dependencies.

Create the following folder structure. The structure is based on the [recommended way](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout) to setup a Go project

```
â”œâ”€â”€ LICENSE
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ cmd
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ envtamer
â”œâ”€â”€ go.mod
â”œâ”€â”€ go.sum
â””â”€â”€ internal
    â”œâ”€â”€ command
    â”œâ”€â”€ storage
    â””â”€â”€ util
```

### Python
