# Getting Started with Python: Core Language Features

This guide covers the fundamental features of Python you need to start building applications. Whether you're coming from another language or new to programming, these concepts will help you understand how Python works and how to use its powerful standard library.

## 1. Python Basics

### Modules and Packages

In Python, every file is a module, and folders with an `__init__.py` file are packages. Modules allow you to organize your code into reusable components.

```python
# greeting.py
def say_hello(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

```python
# main.py
import greeting

greeting.say_hello("Alice")
```

### Importing Modules

You can import individual functions, entire modules, or specific classes:

```python
import math                   # Import the whole module
from math import sqrt          # Import specific function
import os, sys                # Multiple modules can be imported on one line
```

## 2. Variables and Types

### Dynamic Typing

Python is dynamically typed; you don‚Äôt need to declare variable types explicitly.

```python
i = 10              # Integer
f = 3.14            # Float
s = "hello"         # String
b = True            # Boolean
```

### Constants

Python doesn't have built-in constants, but by convention, variables written in all uppercase are treated as constants:

```python
STATUS_OK = 0
STATUS_ERROR = 1
```

### Zero Values and None

In Python, variables that are not initialized are typically set to `None`:

```python
x = None   # Represents the absence of a value
```

## 3. References (No Pointers)

Python uses references to manage objects. Variables are names bound to objects rather than explicit pointers.

```python
x = 10
y = x        # y refers to the same immutable integer 10
lst1 = [1, 2, 3]
lst2 = lst1  # Both lst1 and lst2 refer to the same list
lst2.append(4)
print(lst1)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

## 4. Classes and Constructors

### Defining Classes

Python uses classes to define custom data types and encapsulate behavior. The constructor is defined by the `__init__` method.

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, age):
        if age < 0:
            age = 0  # Simple validation
        self.first_name = first_name
        self.last_name = last_name
        self.age = age

    def full_name(self):
        return f"{self.first_name} {self.last_name}"

    def set_age(self, age):
        if age >= 0:
            self.age = age

# Usage
person = Person("John", "Doe", 30)
print(person.full_name())  # "John Doe"
```

### Class Methods vs. Instance Methods

In Python, methods always receive the instance (`self`) as the first argument.

## 5. Interfaces and Abstract Base Classes

Python uses duck typing, but you can also define interfaces using the `abc` module.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Logger(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def log(self, message: str):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def log_error(self, message: str, err: Exception):
        pass

class ConsoleLogger(Logger):
    def log(self, message: str):
        print(f"INFO: {message}")

    def log_error(self, message: str, err: Exception):
        print(f"ERROR: {message}: {err}")

def process_with_logging(logger: Logger):
    logger.log("Processing started")
    # Do work...
    logger.log("Processing complete")

# Usage
logger = ConsoleLogger()
process_with_logging(logger)
```

## 6. Error Handling

Python uses exceptions for error handling.

```python
try:
    file = open("file.txt", "r")
    content = file.read()
except FileNotFoundError as err:
    print(f"Error: {err}")
finally:
    if 'file' in locals():
        file.close()
```

### Raising Exceptions

```python
def divide(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero")
    return a / b

try:
    result = divide(10, 0)
except ValueError as err:
    print(err)
```

## 7. Context Managers

Use the `with` statement to manage resources like files. It ensures proper cleanup, similar to Go's `defer`.

```python
with open("file.txt", "r") as file:
    for line in file:
        print(line.strip())
```

## 8. Lists (Slices) and Dictionaries (Maps)

### Lists

Lists in Python are dynamic arrays.

```python
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
names.append("Dave")
subset = names[1:3]  # ['Bob', 'Charlie']
```

### Dictionaries

Dictionaries are key-value stores.

```python
ages = {"Alice": 25, "Bob": 30}
ages["Charlie"] = 22

if "Dave" not in ages:
    print("Dave not found")

del ages["Bob"]
```

## 9. Concurrency

Python supports concurrency with threads, processes, and asynchronous programming.

### Using Threads

```python
import threading
import time

def process(id):
    print(f"Processing {id}")
    time.sleep(1)
    print(f"Done {id}")

threads = []
for i in range(1, 3):
    t = threading.Thread(target=process, args=(i,))
    threads.append(t)
    t.start()

for t in threads:
    t.join()
```

### Asynchronous Programming

Python's `asyncio` library enables concurrent code using async/await syntax.

```python
import asyncio

async def process(id):
    print(f"Async processing {id}")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print(f"Async done {id}")

async def main():
    await asyncio.gather(process(1), process(2))

asyncio.run(main())
```

## 10. File Handling

### Reading Files

```python
# Read the entire file
with open("file.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)

# Read line by line
with open("file.txt", "r") as file:
    for line in file:
        print(line.strip())
```

### Writing Files

```python
data = "Hello, World!"
with open("file.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write(data)

# Writing multiple lines
lines = ["Line 1", "Line 2"]
with open("file.txt", "w") as file:
    for line in lines:
        file.write(line + "\n")
```

## 11. Working with JSON

Python provides the `json` module to work with JSON data.

### Serializing (Object to JSON)

```python
import json

person = {
    "name": "John",
    "age": 30,
    "address": None  # Omitted or set to None if not provided
}

json_data = json.dumps(person)
print(json_data)  # {"name": "John", "age": 30, "address": null}
```

### Deserializing (JSON to Object)

```python
json_data = '{"name": "Jane", "age": 25, "address": "123 Main St"}'
person = json.loads(json_data)
print(person)
```

## 12. Testing

Python includes built-in support for testing with the `unittest` module.

```python
# In file: test_math.py
import unittest

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b

class TestMath(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_add(self):
        self.assertEqual(add(2, 3), 5)

    def test_multiply(self):
        test_cases = [
            (2, 3, 6),
            (-1, 5, -5),
            (0, 10, 0),
        ]
        for a, b, expected in test_cases:
            self.assertEqual(multiply(a, b), expected)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

Run tests with:
```
python -m unittest discover
```

## 13. Composition and Inheritance

Python supports composition and inheritance. Use inheritance to share common functionality.

```python
class Address:
    def __init__(self, street, city, zipcode):
        self.street = street
        self.city = city
        self.zipcode = zipcode

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age, address: Address):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.address = address

# Usage
address = Address("123 Main St", "Anytown", "12345")
person = Person("John Doe", 30, address)
print(person.address.city)  # "Anytown"
```

## 14. Visibility Rules

In Python, a single underscore prefix (e.g., `_variable`) indicates that an attribute is intended for internal use. There is no strict enforcement like in other languages.

```python
class User:
    def __init__(self, name, email):
        self.name = name      # Public attribute
        self._email = email   # Private attribute by convention

    def get_email(self):
        return self._email

user = User("Alice", "alice@example.com")
print(user.name)
print(user.get_email())
```

## 15. Type Checks and Dynamic Typing

Although Python is dynamically typed, you can check types using `isinstance` and use type hints for better readability.

```python
def process(value: object):
    if isinstance(value, int):
        print("Integer:", value)
    elif isinstance(value, str):
        print("String:", value)
    else:
        print("Unknown type:", type(value))

process("hello")
```
