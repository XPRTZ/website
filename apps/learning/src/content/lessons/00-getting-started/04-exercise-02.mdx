In this challenge you are given a two‚Äêdimensional ‚Äúengine schematic‚Äù (a grid of characters). Some groups of consecutive digits (a ‚Äúnumber‚Äù) are scattered throughout the grid. However, you should only count a number if at least one of the cells occupied by that number has at least one neighbor (in one of the 8 directions) that is a ‚Äúsymbol.‚Äù Here a symbol is any character that is not a digit and is not a period ("."). In the sample schematic below, the numbers 114 (in the top‚Äêright) and 58 (in the middle‚Äêright) are not adjacent to any symbol, while every other number is. (As in the example, the sum of the valid numbers is 4361.)

For example, given this schematic:

```text
467..114..
...*......
..35..633.
......#...
617*......
.....+.58.
..592.....
......755.
...$.*....
.664.598..
```

The numbers with at least one adjacent (including diagonally) symbol are:

- ‚Äú467‚Äù (adjacent to ‚Äú*‚Äù)
- ‚Äú35‚Äù, ‚Äú633‚Äù, ‚Äú617‚Äù, ‚Äú592‚Äù, ‚Äú755‚Äù, ‚Äú664‚Äù, ‚Äú598‚Äù (each touches a neighboring symbol)
- ‚Äú114‚Äù and ‚Äú58‚Äù are ignored because none of their individual digit positions touches any symbol.
